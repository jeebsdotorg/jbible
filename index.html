jbible is _currently_ a simple command-line application to use as an aid for
Professor Grant Horner's Bible Reading System.  It will tell you which chapters
of the Bible to read on a particular day, based on your progress that you
supply as command line arguments.  You type the jbible command into your
terminal, followed by appropriate arguments (for example, day 31).  The
application will list for you this as its output:

List 1   Mark                Chapter 3
List 2   Genesis             Chapter 31
List 3   I Corinthians       Chapter 15
List 4   I Peter             Chapter 4
List 5   Job                 Chapter 31
List 6   Psalms              Chapter 31
List 7   Proverbs            Chapter 31
List 8   Judges              Chapter 7
List 9   Isaiah              Chapter 31
List 10  Acts                Chapter 3

Please refer to the repository https://github.com/jeebsdotorg/jbible/ and have
a look at the README for more information, as the 'Wishlist' there contains
additional features and functionality for future development.  This project is
developed purely for fun and to hopefully become a better C programmer.

NOTE: You will need a working knowledge of compiling simple C applications with
a Makefile to make this work for you, since no binaries are currently being
released.  It is only being tested on Debian Linux at the moment.

Contributors are welcome!  I may be slow to respond or may not respond at all.

May God bless you all.

jbible:
=======
An application to calculate the chapters you should be reading on day /x/
with Professor Grant Horner's Bible Reading System.

To see the list of chapters for day one:
$ jbible day 1

To see the list of chapters for day nine-hundred and forty-two:
$ jbible day 942

etc...

Fun fact - You will need to read 5,845,262,923,501 consecutive days for the
reading system to restart on Chapter 1 of all lists.
